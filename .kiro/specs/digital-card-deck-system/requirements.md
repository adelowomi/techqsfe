# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The techQ's Digital Card Deck System is a Next.js application that digitally represents the physical card deck format used in the techQ's YouTube game show. The system allows tracking of question usage, contestant attempts, and provides analytics for show production. Each season is represented as a deck of cards with three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard), where each card contains a technology-related question. The system maintains a digital trace of card usage and contestant performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a show host, I want to manage multiple seasons of card decks, so that I can organize questions by show seasons and maintain historical data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new season THEN the system SHALL create three new card decks (easy, medium, hard) for that season
2. WHEN a user views seasons THEN the system SHALL display all available seasons with their creation dates and card counts
3. WHEN a user selects a season THEN the system SHALL show the three difficulty-level decks for that season
4. IF a season has no cards THEN the system SHALL display an empty deck placeholder

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a show producer, I want to add technology questions to specific cards in each difficulty deck, so that I can populate the game show content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a question to a card THEN the system SHALL store the question text, correct answer, and difficulty level
2. WHEN a user creates a question THEN the system SHALL assign it to the next available card number in the selected deck
3. WHEN a user views a card THEN the system SHALL display the question, answer, and usage statistics
4. IF a deck reaches 52 cards THEN the system SHALL prevent adding more cards to that deck
5. WHEN a user edits a question THEN the system SHALL update the card content while preserving usage history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a show host, I want to draw cards from specific difficulty decks during the show, so that contestants receive appropriate difficulty questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user draws a card from a deck THEN the system SHALL randomly select an unused card from that difficulty level
2. WHEN a card is drawn THEN the system SHALL increment the usage count for that specific card
3. WHEN a card is drawn THEN the system SHALL record the draw timestamp and associate it with a contestant attempt
4. IF all cards in a deck have been used THEN the system SHALL allow reshuffling the deck or notify that deck is exhausted
5. WHEN a user views deck status THEN the system SHALL show remaining cards and usage statistics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a show producer, I want to track contestant attempts and performance, so that I can analyze show statistics and contestant engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a contestant attempts a question THEN the system SHALL record their name, question card, answer given, and result (correct/incorrect)
2. WHEN recording an attempt THEN the system SHALL timestamp the attempt and link it to the specific card drawn
3. WHEN a user views contestant statistics THEN the system SHALL display success rates by difficulty level and overall performance
4. WHEN a user views card analytics THEN the system SHALL show how many times each card has been attempted and success rates
5. IF a contestant has multiple attempts THEN the system SHALL maintain separate records for each attempt

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a show producer, I want to view comprehensive analytics about card usage and contestant performance, so that I can make data-driven decisions about question difficulty and show format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses analytics THEN the system SHALL display total attempts, success rates by difficulty, and most/least used cards
2. WHEN viewing season analytics THEN the system SHALL show comparative data across different seasons
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide exportable data about card usage and contestant performance
4. WHEN viewing real-time statistics THEN the system SHALL update counts and percentages as new attempts are recorded
5. IF no data exists for a metric THEN the system SHALL display appropriate zero-state messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage user access and authentication, so that only authorized personnel can modify questions and record contestant attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access the system THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN an authenticated user logs in THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate access based on their role (host, producer, admin)
3. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL redirect to login and prevent data modification
4. IF a user session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before allowing further actions
5. WHEN user roles are assigned THEN the system SHALL enforce permission-based access to different features
